FAVICON PLACEHOLDER

A favicon.ico file should be placed in this directory (app/eqms/static/favicon.ico).

The favicon link has been added to the layout template. To complete the setup:

1. Create or obtain a 32x32 or 64x64 pixel .ico file
2. Name it "favicon.ico"
3. Place it in this directory (app/eqms/static/)

The favicon will then be automatically served by Flask's static file handler.
